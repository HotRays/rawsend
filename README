[rawsend]

This is a modified version of Cozybits initial code[1] for sending ethernet packets from one local interface to another.

It is modified to mimic the behaviour of iperf, so that one can specify a rate to be transmitted 

[usage]

Since rawsend uses raw sockets, it has to be run as superuser.

First, start the client by specifying the interface to listen on:

   # ./server wlan1

Then, start the client by specifying the source and destination interfaces as well as the rate in kbit/s and timeout in seconds:

   # ./client wlan0 wlan1 500 10

And if successful, the server and the client will print some results.
